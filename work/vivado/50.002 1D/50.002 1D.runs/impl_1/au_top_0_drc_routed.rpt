DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP auto/alu/adder/s0 output auto/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP game/control/alu/adder/s0 output game/control/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP manual/alu/adder/s0 output manual/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP auto/alu/adder/s0 multiplier stage auto/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP game/control/alu/adder/s0 multiplier stage game/control/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#3 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP manual/alu/adder/s0 multiplier stage manual/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

DSP rand_auto/rand_gen/alu/adder/s0 multiplier stage rand_auto/rand_gen/alu/adder/s0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
46 out of 106 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: io_dip[21], io_dip[20], io_dip[19], io_dip[18], io_dip[17], io_dip[16],
io_dip[15], io_dip[14], io_dip[13], io_dip[12], io_dip[11], io_dip[10],
io_dip[9], io_dip[8], io_dip[7] (the first 15 of 23 listed).
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net auto/slowclk/M_slowclkedge_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin auto/slowclk/M_last_q_i_2__10/O, cell auto/slowclk/M_last_q_i_2__10. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net segtest/slowclkedge/M_slowclkedge_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin segtest/slowclkedge/M_last_q_i_2__4/O, cell segtest/slowclkedge/M_last_q_i_2__4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT auto/slowclk/M_last_q_i_2__10 is driving clock pin of 6 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
auto/M_auto_controller_q_reg[0], auto/M_auto_controller_q_reg[1],
auto/M_auto_controller_q_reg[2], auto/M_auto_controller_q_reg[3],
auto/M_auto_controller_q_reg[4],
auto/buttondetector_gen_0[1].buttondetector/M_last_q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT segtest/slowclkedge/M_last_q_i_2__4 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
segtest/M_auto_controller_q_reg[0], segtest/M_auto_controller_q_reg[1],
segtest/M_auto_controller_q_reg[2],
segtest/buttondetector_gen_0[1].buttondetector/M_last_q_reg
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
46 out of 106 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: io_dip[21], io_dip[20], io_dip[19], io_dip[18], io_dip[17], io_dip[16],
io_dip[15], io_dip[14], io_dip[13], io_dip[12], io_dip[11], io_dip[10],
io_dip[9], io_dip[8], io_dip[7] (the first 15 of 23 listed).
